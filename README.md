# FleetCarrierFuelCalculator
A simple program to calculate the tritium consumption of the Fleet Carrier from Elite Dangerous. The program calculates consumption based on the formula from the ED forum thread (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/how-much-the-fleet-carrier-consumes-for-ly.563024/post-9791318).
Set the jump range, enter the amount of materials and tritium and press the "Calculate" button and the program will calculate the fuel consumption.
